Last one out loses

Description

Last one out loses is a simple game where a playing surface is covered with at least 20 items (sticks, coins, 

etc.). There are two players, each of which may remove 1 to 3 items. The person who removes the final item 

to clear the playing surface loses the game.

An example

‣ the game starts with 20 items

‣ player1; removes 3 items (17 remaining)

‣ player2; removes 1 item (16 remaining)

‣ player1; removes 3 items (13 remaining)

‣ player2; removes 2 items (11 remaining)

‣ player1; removes 1 item (10 remaining)

‣ player2; removes 3 items (7 remaining)

‣ player1; removes 2 items (4 remaining)

‣ player2; removes 3 items (1 remaining)

‣ player1; removes the last item and loses

Assignment

Part 1 — Create an application that allows a user to play this game against a friend or a computer. This 

application should present the playing surface in a visual way, provide a good/understandable user 

interface for the game and finally congratulate the winner.

When the user plays against the computer, the computer-player should (of course) try to win as much as 

possible.

Share your solution both as source-code and as a runnable example.

Part 2 — Show or explain how you structured the application, e.g. by describing or sharing an architecture.

Part 3 — Share some insights on how you approached the visual side of the application — the user interface, 

the playing surface, the win-state, etc.

Part 4 —Do you think the game is fair? Does any player have an advantage by going first? Is this true for any 

number of items on the playing surface? Is this provable?
